📝 Notes


* The output looks best on terminals that support ANSI colors.

* If your terminal does not show colors, try using Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or any Linux terminal.

The rich library must be installed; otherwise, the script will not run.

You can easily adjust styles by modifying the column style values in the script.
